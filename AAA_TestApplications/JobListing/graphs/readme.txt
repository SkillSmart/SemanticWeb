This Part documents the creation and update of the Company Knowledge Graph

It organizes the ongoing extraction of relevant Company related information using spiders, 
accesses external Datasources for Update based on semantically matched API connectors, 
and uses a library of graph enabled ML Algorithms to continously integrate and update 
its own content. 

The Goal here is to:
- Develop more and more data integration interfaces
- Store relevant information about the datasources and the statistics of when and how the 
  Data has been stored into the Graph
- Continously investigate the trust in each datasource during production and enable smart
  Feedback loops to pinpoint areas of weak or false Data automatically
